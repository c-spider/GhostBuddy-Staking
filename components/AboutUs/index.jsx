                <p>A sophisticated factory system for quality games will be developed where incubated games can choose a level of incubation to suit their needs. Game developers will have access to games infrastructure modules for scalability, security and performance. Additionally, a team of game developers and 2D/3D artists will be at hand to make vision into reality. In exchange for incubation, $XSEED token holders will benefit from receiving free airdrops of the new games in proportion to their holdings. Games developers will have access to reusable code, 3D models, modules and components. Regular audits will be conducted to ensure integrity of the platform and associated games.</p>
